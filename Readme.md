Excellent — this is *exactly* the right mindset to have for learning microservices properly: not just “spinning up multiple apps,” but designing them around clear boundaries, communication, and deployment strategy.

Let’s treat this as if I’m your **senior architect**, and you’re the **developer** on the project. Below is a **developer-facing document** you’d receive — just like in a real company when you’re assigned to implement part of a microservice system.

# 🧩 Project Specification: "ChatFlow" — A Learning Microservices System

**Objective:**
Build a modular **ChatGPT-like system** using **Spring Boot microservices**, demonstrating service discovery, inter-service communication, and API gateway routing.
The project simulates a simplified AI pipeline — message handling, model processing, and user management — but focuses on *architecture and service orchestration*, not AI.

## 🧱 Microservices Breakdown

### 1️⃣ **Eureka Discovery Server**

* Registers all services dynamically.
* Allows them to locate each other without hardcoding URLs.
* Tech: `Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server`

**Responsibilities:**

* Host registry of all services.
* Handle heartbeat checks.

---

### 2️⃣ **Config Server**

* Centralized configuration for all microservices.
* Backed by a Git repository or local file system.
* Tech: `Spring Cloud Config Server`

**Responsibilities:**

* Serve configurations to all services on startup.
* Enable live configuration refresh with `@RefreshScope`.

---

### 3️⃣ **API Gateway**

* Entry point for all client requests.
* Routes requests to internal services.
* Handles authentication & logging.

**Responsibilities:**

* Routing (e.g., `/user/**` → user-service)
* Authentication filter (JWT)
* Logging and request tracing.

Tech Stack:

* `Spring Cloud Gateway`
* `Spring Boot 3`
* `Resilience4j` for fallback handling.

---

### 4️⃣ **User Service**

* Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
* Persists user data in a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database.

**Responsibilities:**

* `POST /register` → create user
* `POST /login` → issue JWT
* `GET /profile/{id}` → get user details

---

### 5️⃣ **Chat Service**

* Handles chat message lifecycle: receive → forward → store.
* Acts as a middle layer between user and model service.

**Responsibilities:**

* Receive messages from users.
* Forward them asynchronously to Model Service.
* Store chat history (MongoDB recommended).

---

### 6️⃣ **Model Service**

* Simulates “AI text generation.”
* In real systems this would call an ML model — here it will just generate fake but formatted responses.

**Responsibilities:**

* Receive prompts.
* Return a “simulated AI response.”
* (Optional) Introduce artificial delay to mimic computation time.

## 🔄 Inter-Service Communication

| From         | To            | Method             | Description                 |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Chat Service | Model Service | REST / Async Queue | Sends prompt for processing |
| Chat Service | User Service  | REST               | Verify user identity        |
| API Gateway  | All           | HTTP               | Routes external requests    |

Optional Advanced Addition:

* Use **RabbitMQ/Kafka** between Chat ↔ Model for async message flow.
* Or **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** for synchronous REST calls.

---

## 🧩 Data Flow Example

1. **User** hits `/api/chat/send` → goes to **API Gateway**.
2. Gateway routes to **Chat Service** after JWT verification.
3. **Chat Service** validates user from **User Service**.
4. **Chat Service** sends message to **Model Service**.
5. **Model Service** returns a generated response.
6. **Chat Service** saves it in MongoDB and returns final chat result.

---

## ☁️ Deployment Plan (Learning Mode)

You can simulate production with **Docker Compose**.

### Docker Compose Services:

* `eureka-server`
* `config-server`
* `api-gateway`
* `user-service`
* `chat-service`
* `model-service`
* `postgres` (for user service)
* `mongodb` (for chat service)

Each service should:

* Register with Eureka.
* Fetch config from Config Server.
* Be reachable via API Gateway.

## 🚀 Learning Goals

By completing this system, you’ll understand:

* Service registration and discovery (Eureka)

* Gateway routing and filters
* Inter-service REST/Feign communication
* Containerized deployment with Docker Compose
* Basic monitoring via Actuator

Would you like me to extend this document with:

* ✅ **Detailed folder structure + config file layout** (like `/config-server/src/main/resources/application.yml`)
  or
* ✅ **Implementation roadmap (week-by-week learning plan)** to execute it step by step?

Which one should I write next for you?
